SC/ST Atrocity Monitoring System

📌 Project Overview

The SC/ST Atrocity Monitoring System is a web-based application designed to track, manage, and monitor cases related to atrocities against Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). The system enables coordinated communication and data flow between Police Stations, SP Office, Collector Office, and Social Welfare Department to ensure transparency, accountability, and timely action.
